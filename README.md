The spotted lanternfly (SLF) has emerged as a significant threat in the northeastern United States, causing environmental and economic disruptions in forestry and agriculture. Efforts are underway to understand the human impact on SLF's spread, utilizing computational models to analyze factors like gardening habits, traveler movement, and climate change. The Spotted Lanternfly Migration Model (SLFMM) is introduced to predict SLF movement, considering factors such as life cycle, habitat, death rate, migration patterns, food sources, and environmental conditions. The SLF's life cycle, habitat preferences, and economic impact on crops, particularly soybeans, grapes, and stone fruits, are discussed. The SLFMM's development process involves an interdisciplinary approach, combining biology and computer science, to create a realistic model. Challenges include data alignment issues, but the model proves useful for predicting species migration and population growth. Beyond its application to SLF, the model's potential for other species and its contribution to ecological research are highlighted, emphasizing its role in understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive species on ecosystems and economies.

To run simulation:
1) Download all the data sets and files asscoiated with project to Desktop and put into go/src
2) Name folder: LanternFly
3) Open in Visual Studios
4) Navigate to go/src in Terminal
5) Then type go build and type ./LanternFly and hit enter. 

Attached is the code demonstration of our code and what it looks like: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-qEsGAtsLLsVtCm4fkO0C8uZSR7M8En9/view?usp=sharing
